# Akari Source Code
- Just the source code of Jordy Nateur's Akari project.
- I have no connection to the project or intention to progress the development of it.
- Not tested on new versions of CFW / HEN (4.89/4.90).
- Use at your own risk.


# Original description


# Akari
A fully customizable VSH menu with multiple functionalities.
(don't use it, it's garbage)

## Notes
- Supports only 720p/1080p
- Only tested on 4.84 DEX with Cobra 8.3 and on 4.82 & 4.88 CEX with HEN 3.0.3 Debug
- Should work on all 4.75+ firmwares (CEX/DEX/DECR) as long as it is loaded via Cobra, Mamba or HEN
